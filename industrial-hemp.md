## It's legal to grow and process industrial hemp in Louisiana--if you follow the rules
### The Basics
The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry regulates production and processing of industrial hemp, which it defines as:
> all plant parts and varieties of the cannabis plant and any part of the plant cultivated or possessed by an industrial hemp licensee, with a total THC concentration level of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.
#### Industrial hemp
- Comes from the same plant family as medical marijuana (Cannabis Sativa), but contains far less of the psychoactive substance known as THC. (less than .3 vs up to 38% for medical marijuana)
- Has been grown for centuries for its versatile fiber and nutritious seeds. 
- May contain large quantities of non-psychoactive Cannabidiol (CBD,) whose potential health benefits Science are still being studied.

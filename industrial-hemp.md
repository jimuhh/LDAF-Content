## It's legal to grow and process industrial hemp in Louisiana--if you follow the rules
Industrial hemp has been grown for centuries for its versatile fiber and nutritious seeds. It comes from the same plant family as medical marijuana (Cannabis Sativa) but contains far less of the psychoactive sustance, THC. (less than .3% vs up to 38% for medical marijuana).

The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry regulates production and sale of Industrial hemp, which it defines as:
> all plant parts and varieties of the cannabis plant and any part of the plant cultivated or possessed by an industrial hemp licensee, with a total THC concentration level of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.

### Who manages what
- **Production and processing of industrial hemp:** are regulated by The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry
- **Production and processing of medical marijuana:** are regulated by [The Louisiana Board of Health](https://ldh.la.gov/) This includes ingestible or topical products containing Cannabidiol (**CBD**) 
- **Sales of CBD products** must be registered through [the Louisiana Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control](https://atc.louisiana.gov/).


### General Requirements
All growers and processors must:
- Apply for and obtain a license 
- Pay $500 
- Pass a background check
- Buy only seeds that LDAF has designated as containing less than .3% THC.
